# Introduction to Differential Equations

## Basic concepts

### How to define a differential equation in Maple

Depending on the differentiation command, there are three ways to define a differential equation in Maple.

::: {.example}

Assign the differential equation $y'=2y$ to a variable `ode1` in Maple.

:::

::: {.solution}

- Method 1: Using the `diff` command
  
  ```
  ode1:=diff(y(x), x)=2*y(x)
  ```

- Method 2: Using the the prime derivative notation
  
  ```
  ode1:=y'=2y
  ```

- Method 3: Using the command `D`
  
  ```
  ode1:=D(y)(x)=2*y(x)
  ```

Among the three methods, the one using `diff` is the standard choice.

::: {.exercise}

Assign the differential equation $y'=y(1-0.001y)$ to a variable `ode2` in Maple.

### How to check solutions

To check a solution, you may use the `subs` command with the option `eval` to see if the left-hand side and right-hand side of the equation are the same.

::: {.example}

Verify that $y=ce^{2x}$ is a solution to the differential equation $y'=2y$.

:::

::: {.solution}

You may first assign the differential equation to a variable and using the `subs` command, or combine them into one command.

```
subs[eval](y(x)=c*exp(2*x), diff(y(x), x)=2*y(x))
```

:::

Note that if you have an implicit solution, then the above mentioned method does not work well. You may have to find the derivative using the `implicitdiff` command.

::: {.exercise}

Verify that the function $y=c_1e^x+c_2e^{-x}$ is a solution of the equation $y''=y$.

## Direction fields

In Maple, the commands `DEplot`, `dfieldplot`, and `phaseportrait` supported by the package `DETools` can be used to plot the direction field and solution curves. The basic usage is as follows

```
DEplot(differential equation, function, ranges, options)
```

Again, using the command `?DEplot`, we can find details and examples on the command. In the following, I will use `DEplot` as an example to show how they work.

::: {.example}

Plot the direction field for the differential equation $y'=-\frac xy$. Can you guess what is a solution to this equation?

:::

::: {.solution}

Let's first define the differential equations and assign it to a variable `ode3`.

```
ode3:=diff(y(x), x)=-x/(y(x))
```

Now load the package `DETools` using the command `with()`.

```
with(DETools):
```

With the package loaded, we can use `DEplot` to plot the direction field for `ode3`, say in the region $-5\le x\le 5$ and $-5\le y\le 5$.

```
DEplot(ode3, y(x), x =-5..5, y =-5..5, title = " Direction Field for y'=-x/y ")
```

Note that one may change the outlook by add options, such as color and arrows. Running the following command, you will see the difference.

```
DEplot(diff(y(x), x) = -(x - 1)/(y(x) + 1), y(x), x = -5 .. 5, y = -5 .. 5, 
title = "Direction Field for y'=2 y", color = -(x - 1)/(y(x) + 1), arrows = line)
```

The direction field suggests that solutions are circles.

Plot the direction field for the differential equation $y'=-\frac{x-1}{y+1}$. Can you guess what is a solution to this equation?

Plot the direction field for the differential equation $y'=-\frac{x}{2y}$. Can you guess what is a solution to this equation?
