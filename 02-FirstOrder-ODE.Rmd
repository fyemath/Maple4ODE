# First Order Differential Equations

## Classification

Knowing the type of a differential equation will be very helpful for solving it. In Maple, we can use the command `odeadvisor(ode, y(x))` supported by the package `DETools` to learn what type of equation is it.

::: {.example}

Determine the primary type of each of the following differential equations.

1. $y'=xy$
2. $y'=xy+1$
3. $y'=xy+y^2$
4. $y'=\frac{xy}{x^2+y^2}$

:::

::: {.solution}

We first load the package `DETools` anonymously.

```
with(DETools):
```

Now we can classify those equations using `odeadvisor`.

```
odeadvisor(diff(y(x),x)=x*y(x));
odeadvisor(diff(y(x),x)=x*y(x)+1);
odeadvisor(diff(y(x),x)=x*y(x)+y(x)^2;
odeadvisor(diff(y(x), x) = (x*y(x))/(x^2 + y(x)^2));
```

::: {.exercise}

Determine the primary type of each of the following differential equations.

1. $y'=x^2y^2+x^2$
2. $y'=x^2y+x$
3. $y'=xy+y^3$
4. $y'=\frac{x-y}{x+y}$

## Solving differential equations

To solve an ordinary differential equation, or a system of them, or initial value problems, you may use the command `dsolve({ODE, InitialConditions}, y(x), options)`, where the initial conditions may be omitted to get a general solution. Note that `dsolve` returns an equation with $y(x)$ on the left.

Among options, you may choose to use different method to solve the equations, for example, `numeric`, `series` or `method=laplace` are options that can be imposed and will be used later.

::: {.example}

Consider the differential equation
$$y'=2y+x.$$

1. Find the general solution.
2. Find the solution that satisfies the initial condition $y(0)=1$.
3. Plot the solution curve of the initial value problem.

:::

::: {.solution}

It will be convenient to define the differential equation first.

```
ode221:=diff(y(x), x)=2*y(x)+x:
```

The general solution can be obtained by the following command.

```
dsolve(ode221, y(x));
```

The solution of the initial value problem can be obtained by

```
sol221:=dsolve({ode221, y(0)=1}, y(x));
```

To plot the solution curve, we need to get the function expression instead of the equation. This can be done using the command `rhs`.

```
plot(rhs(sol221), x=-5..5)
```

:::

::: {.example}

Consider the differential equation
$$y'=x+y.$$

1. Find the general solution.
2. Find the solution that satisfies the initial condition $y(0)=1$.
3. Plot the solution curve of the initial value problem.

## Integrating factors

In Maple, you may use `intfactor` that is supported by the package `DETools` to find an integrating factor for a given ODE. To test an integrating factor, you may use `mutest` which is again supported by the package `DETools`. If the command returns a 0, then the expression being tested is an integrating factor.

::: {.example}

Find an integrating factor for the equations $y'=x^2y-x$ and test it using `mutest`.

:::

::: {.solution}

Let's first define the differential equation.

```
ode231:=diff(y(x), x)=x^2*y(x)-x:
```

Now loading the package and find an integrating factor $\mu$.

```
with(DETools):
mu:=intfactor(ode231);
```

To test it, you may run the following command.

```
mutest(mu, ode231, y(x));
```

:::

::: {.exercise}

$$xy'=y-x.$$
