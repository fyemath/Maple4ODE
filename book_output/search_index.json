Maple start page screenshot If you already know what you want to do, then you may open a new document by clicking New Document icon in the start document. The following shows what an new (empty document) looks like. Maple new document page screenshot In the context bar of this new document, the current mode is indicated. Different Modes in Maple Initially, the Text mode is in use. You may switch to another mode by clicking one of the three modes: Text, Nonexecutable math, or Math. Alternatively, you may use the F5 shortcut key, to toggle between these three modes in sequence: text entry, nonexecutable math entry, and executable math. If you want to explore some featured sample documents, you may go to Start.mw document and click on different icons to open a new document. You may alway reopen the start page by click the home icon located in the Toolbar to reopen the start page. To seek help in Maple is easy, in the Math mode, type in the keywords after the question mark ? and press ENTER, you will see a new window popping out with searched results. For example, typing in ?solve and pressing ENTER will open the following window. Using the ENTER key, the result will appear in the next line. To get the result in the SAME line, you may use ALT+ENTER. 1.2 Basic Operators Use the command ?operators, you may find descriptions of arithmetic operators in Maple. addition subtraction multiplication division exponentiation Maple Operators + - * / ^ In writing \\(x+2\\) \\(a-b\\) \\(2x\\) \\(\\dfrac pq\\) \\(b^5\\) In Maple x+2 a-b 2*x p/q b^5 Among all operators in Maple, we will frequently use the assignment operator :=. You will see examples in the next section. 1.3 Variables Variables in Maple can be defined using combinations of letters, digits, and underscores, but not beginning with a digit. For example, we frequently use letters as well as letters followed by a number as variable names. Words connected by underscores are also frequently used as variable names. Note that there are reserved combinations. Those combinations are not allowed in Maple. For example, if you use sin as a variable name and try to assign 1 to it using the command sin:=1. You will see the following error message Error, attempting to assign to sin which is protected. Try declaring local sin; see ?protect for details. 1.4 How to define a function A function is an assignment, for a given input \\(x\\), we assignment an output \\(y\\) under a certain rule. Maple takes this idea to define functions. function name:= independent variable -&gt; function rule Here := means defined/assigned to be and the arrow operator -&gt; may be understood as plug in. The assignment operator := to the left-hand side the value of the right-hand side. The left-hand side normally is a name and the right-hand side is a value or expression. As far as I know, starting from Maple 2019, one can also define a function using the syntax: functionname(independent variable) := expression Example 1.1 Define the following function in Maple and find the value \\(f(0.999)\\). \\[f(x)=\\dfrac{x}{x-1}\\] Solution. The function name is \\(f\\), the independent variable is \\(x\\) and the function rule is \\(\\dfrac{x}{x-1}\\). So the function can be defined in Maple by the following command. f:=x-&gt;x/(x-1) Once the function is define, you may find the function value using the following the command. f(0.999) Exercise 1.1 Define the following function in Maple and find the value \\(f(2.0001)\\). \\[ g(x)=\\dfrac{x^3}{(x-2)^2} \\] 1.5 Initially known mathematical functions Maple has many predefined functions which can be used to create new functions. To see all initially known mathematical functions in maple, you may use the help command ?functions and click the hyperlinked initial functions in the description shown in the new window. Maple function help page screenshot Some frequently used functions are listed in tables below. absolute value square root n-th root natural exponential logarithmic abs() sqrt() surd(,n) exp() log(),log[b](), ln() sine cosine tangent cotangent secant cosecant sin() cos() tan() cot() sec() csc() inverse sine inverse cosine inverse tangent inverse cotangent inverse secant inverse cosecant arcsin() arccos() arctan() arccot() arcsec() arccsc() 1.6 Plot functions In Maple, you may plot a single variable function easily using the command plot(expression, domain, options) or plot several single variable functions together using plot([experssion1, experssion2], domain, options) In the command, options may be omitted, but the domain must be given. To see details about available options, you may run the command ?plot in Maple. Example 1.2 Plot the functions \\(f(x)=x^2\\) in red and \\(l(x)=2x+1\\) in blue over the domain \\([-1, 2]\\). Solution. Here are the command and the output plot([x^2, 2*x+1], x=-1..2, color=[red, blue]) Screen shot of the output generated by plotting of two function Exercise 1.2 Plot the piecewise function in Exercise ?? over the domain \\([-2, 4]\\). Exercise 1.3 Plot the functions \\(f(x)=\\ln(x+5)\\) and \\(g(x)=3\\cos(2x+1)+4\\) over the domain \\([-\\pi, \\pi]\\). "]]
